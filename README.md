## ⚙️ Architecture Overview
### Microservices Architecture:
Each service is an independent codebase with its own database and container.

### API Gateway & Load Balancing:
Nginx handles routing and balances load between multiple service instances.

### Containerization:
Docker ensures consistent environments and isolated service deployments.

<!-- ### Deployment with Kubernetes:
Each service runs in its own pod. Kubernetes handles auto-scaling, fault tolerance, and rolling updates. -->

### CI/CD Pipeline:
GitHub Actions automates builds, tests, and deployment to Docker Hub or a container registry.

### Authentication & Authorization:
JWT tokens are used for auth; passwords are hashed securely using argon2.

## ✅ Pre-requisites
Docker & Docker Compose installed:

docker --version

docker compose version

.env files:

Ensure all services have properly configured .env files (e.g., DB URLs, JWT secrets, API keys, etc.)

## 🚀 Running the Project (Recommended Way)

docker compose up --build -d

## 🔁 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
To enable CI/CD deployment via GitHub Actions:

Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions → New Repository Secret.

Add the following secrets:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username

DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password or access token
