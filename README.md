🧩 Services & Features
Service	Description
User Service	User registration, login, JWT authentication, argon2 password hashing
Product Service	Manage product listings, categories, inventory
Shopping Cart Service	Add/remove/update items in user carts
Order Service	Place orders, track status, manage order history
Payment Service	Integrate Stripe for secure payment handling
Notification Service	Send email (via NodeMailer) & SMS (via Twilio) notifications

⚙️ Architecture Overview
Microservices Architecture:
Each service is an independent codebase with its own database and container.

API Gateway & Load Balancing:
Nginx handles routing and balances load between multiple service instances.

Containerization:
Docker ensures consistent environments and isolated service deployments.

Deployment with Kubernetes:
Each service runs in its own pod. Kubernetes handles auto-scaling, fault tolerance, and rolling updates.

CI/CD Pipeline:
GitHub Actions automates builds, tests, and deployment to Docker Hub or a container registry.

Authentication & Authorization:
JWT tokens are used for auth; passwords are hashed securely using argon2.

✅ Pre-requisites
Docker & Docker Compose installed:

bash
Sao chép
Chỉnh sửa
docker --version
docker compose version
.env files:
Ensure all services have properly configured .env files (e.g., DB URLs, JWT secrets, API keys, etc.)

🚀 Running the Project (Recommended Way)
bash
Sao chép
Chỉnh sửa
docker compose up --build
--build: Ensures services are rebuilt if any code changes are detected.

🔁 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
To enable CI/CD deployment via GitHub Actions:

Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions → New Repository Secret.

Add the following secrets:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username

DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password or access token
